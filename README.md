# RandomizedAlgorithms
Project for Computer Algorithms class. Implements the random select algorithm and the Monte Carlo algorithm for determining the area under a curve.

The results of running both algorithms are presented in a tabular format using JavaFX tables. The Monte Carlo simulation also shows a line graph that represents the error percentage for each equation with respect to the number of points used.

The results of running the Monte Carlo algorithm for determining the area under a curve for each of the equations using a variable number of guesses.

Shows the error percentage for each equation with respect to the number of guesses.

Shows how long it took to find the third smallest element in a randomly generated array of differing sizes.


#### Notes
The equations were rendered using the [JLaTeXMath](http://forge.scilab.org/index.php/p/jlatexmath/) library.
