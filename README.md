# RandomizedAlgorithms
Project for Computer Algorithms class. Implements the random select algorithm. Also implements the Monte Carlo algorithm for determining the area under a curve.

The results of running both algorithms are presented in a tabular format using JavaFX tables. The Monte Carlo simulation also shows a line graph that represents the error percentage for each equation with respect to the number of points used.

#### Notes
The equations were rendered using the [JLaTeXMath](http://forge.scilab.org/index.php/p/jlatexmath/) library.
